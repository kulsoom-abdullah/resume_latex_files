## Latex Resume Template

This is a single-page, one-column resume for tech related fields. It is a modification of [Sourabh Bajajâ€™s LaTex files](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume)

From the description: *It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting.*

## Modifications

I have made some modifications, such as adding a publications section that references a .bib file, and allow the hyperlinks to show in a different font color from the default black text.  I also wanted to have sub indents in a list and used the `\begin{quote} \end{quote}` command to achieve this.

I find Latex easier to work with v.s. Word when keeping formatting consistent, making edits and changes.  Hope this helps anyone out there!  

If you have any feedback, I welcome it.
